# Rental Car System
The RCar System replaces Ikram Motors Enterprise's traditional paper-based car rental management with a database system, enhancing efficiency and user experience. Since its inception in 2018, the company has grown, necessitating a more efficient system. Problems with the current method include inefficient data management, manual car availability checks, and cumbersome customer registration processes. The proposed solution involves a database to avoid data redundancy, ensure data security, and provide real-time car availability updates. The system is operationally, technically, and economically feasible, aiming to improve customer satisfaction, streamline record tracking, and simplify the user interface. The scope includes online reservations, report generation, and car information display, excluding advertising, car tracking, and maintenance tips.
